# Knight online tbl shell

This is a small utility which allows knight online tbl files to be converted to a SQLite database. The tool can migrate its' SQLite database contents to MSSQL databases.

No usage manual will be given, since a long time passed, and I don't have a working environment to compile and try this project.
